## Intentions and goals of Hybocracy
Our MTP - is: *Selfless governance, the world over*. That's a Massive, Transformative, Purpose. 

Hybocracy came to be when a group of people got together to talk about building a mobile voting app, but quickly spawned into something much more. When put under the spotlight the whole voting thing is starting to show its age no matter how good the app that surrounds it may be. Instead, we started to look into the future, how will the world be run in five, ten or twenty years from now? How can technology assist us in this transformation and to what extent should it?

After ten months of debate we finally realised that you can't build everything all at once, you need to break it up into phases, here are the five phases of Hybocracy:

# Phase One: Engagement
**Goal:** Community activism

Globalisation and Consumerism have tought us that it's ok to live on our own, the only thing that's important is to look after yourself at the expense of everyone else. In phase one we start to engage citizens to start a conversation with one another.

Neighbours are often too shy to talk to one another apart from the occasional "good morning". Here we'll use technology as an ice breaker to overcome our shyness. We'll get to know one another in a virtual world so that we'll know each other in the physical one.

A community can be a:
1. House or Apartment building
2. Street
3. Neighbourhood
4. City

How?
Flyers.

When?
Meetups integration.

We start a community conversation

Organise joint events.


Why?
