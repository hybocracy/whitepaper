## Intentions and goals of Hybocracy
Our MTP - is: *Selfless governance, the world over*. That's a Massive, Transformative, Purpose. 

Hybocracy came to be when a group of people got together to talk about building a mobile voting app, but quickly spawned into something much more. When put under the spotlight the whole voting thing is starting to show its age no matter how good the app that surrounds it may be. Instead, we started to look into the future, how will the world be run in five, ten or twenty years from now? How can technology assist us in this transformation and to what extent should it?

After ten months of debate we finally realised that you can't build everything all at once, you need to break it up into phases, here are the five phases of Hybocracy:

### Phase One: Engagement
**Goal:** Community activism

Globalisation and Consumerism have taught us that it's ok to live on our own, to value *things* over relationships. If we are to evolve to the next level of democracy, it's essential that we have strong local communities where citizens understand and support one another.

In phase one we start to engage citizens to start a conversation with one another. Neighbours are often too shy to talk to one another apart from the occasional "good morning". Here we'll use technology as an icebreaker to overcome our shyness. We'll get to know one another in a virtual world so that we'll know each other in the physical one.

A community can be a:
1. House or Apartment building
2. Street
3. Neighbourhood
4. City

Engagement
Founding members of new communities will be provided with a printable PDF. They are encouraged to go door to door to introduce themselves and the new group.

Requirements: 
i) Create a group.
ii) Invite community members to the group.
iii) Ability to send group wide messages to one another.

### Phase Two: Local Economy
**Goal:** Establish local sharing and services economy

A strong local economy is an important step in moving away from dependency on corporations and will bring value back into the community. The environment will thank us for enabling local people to consume local produce.

In phase one we had communities sharing on an ad hoc basis “Does anyone have a lawnmower that I can borrow?”. In phase two we take this one step further by allowing citizens to register the things they have that may be borrowed.

In order to make sharing fair we’ll introduce a *Citizen Coin* that community members can exchange in return for borrowing an item. The lender may then use that coin for maintenance purposes.

Some local shops and farms may choose to accept Citizen Coin in exchange for goods, like bread and vegetables.

Amature services may also be provided using Citizen Coins to keep things fair. For example a student may need help with their studies, a local neighbour may be an expert in this field and could help out. Likewise that neighbour might require some childcare one evening. Citizen coins are used to ensure that every citizen’s time is valued equally and no one is taken advantage of.

**Note:** The *Citizen Coins* will not generate interest, it is purely a means of exchange. *Citizen Coins* are not exchangeable to other currencies. Human relations are key to Citizen Coins.

Requirements: 
i) Issuance of Citizen Coins.
ii) Ability to transact between citizens.
iii) Registration of assets that may be lent.
