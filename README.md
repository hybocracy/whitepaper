## Intentions and goals of Hybocracy
Our **MTP** - is: *Selfless governance, the world over*. That's a Massive, Transformative, Purpose. 

Hybocracy came to be when a group of people got together to talk about building a mobile voting app, but quickly spawned into something much more. When put under the spotlight the whole voting thing is starting to show its age, no matter how good the app that surrounds it may be. Instead, we started to look into the future, how will the world be run in five, ten or twenty years from now? How can technology assist us in this transformation and, to what extent should it?

One of the first things we realised was that where historically as we grew from small hunter gatherer units, it was not possible to make decisions together mainly due to communication constraints. This is the major argument for representative democracy, where you choose someone from your community to represent you. Today, this argument no longer holds true. Modern technology and protocols like distributed ledgers (Blockchain) allow us to openly communicate and make decisions together.

After ten months of research and debate we finally realised that you can't build everything all at once, you need to break it up into phases, here are the five phases of Hybocracy: 

### Phase One: Engagement
**Goal:** Community activism

Globalisation and Consumerism have taught us that it's ok to live on our own, to value *things* over relationships. If we are to evolve to the next level of democracy, it's essential that we have strong local communities where citizens understand and support one another.

In phase one we start to engage citizens to start a conversation with one another. Neighbours are often too shy to talk to one another apart from the occasional "good morning". Here we'll use technology as an icebreaker to overcome our shyness. We'll get to know one another in a virtual world so that we'll know each other in the physical one.

A community can be a:
1. House or Apartment building
2. Street
3. Neighbourhood
4. City

Engagement
Founding members of new communities will be provided with a printable PDF. They are encouraged to go door to door to introduce themselves and the new group.

**Requirements**:
i) Create a group.
ii) Invite community members to the group.
iii) Ability to send group wide messages to one another.

### Phase Two: Local Economy
**Goal:** Establish local sharing and services economy

A strong local economy is an important step in moving away from dependency on corporations and will bring value back into the community. The environment will thank us for enabling local people to consume local produce.

In phase one we had communities sharing on an ad hoc basis “Does anyone have a lawnmower that I can borrow?”. In phase two we take this one step further by allowing citizens to register the things they have that may be borrowed.

In order to make sharing fair we’ll introduce a *Citizen Coin* that community members can exchange in return for borrowing an item. The lender may then use that coin for maintenance purposes.

Some local shops and farms may choose to accept Citizen Coin in exchange for goods, like bread and vegetables.

Amature services may also be provided using Citizen Coins to keep things fair. For example a student may need help with their studies, a local neighbour may be an expert in this field and could help out. Likewise that neighbour might require some childcare one evening. Citizen coins are used to ensure that every citizen’s time is valued equally and no one is taken advantage of.

**Note:** The *Citizen Coins* are tied to silver, conversion to Fiat currencies must pass through silver. Human relations are key to Citizen Coins.

**Requirements**:
* Issuance of Citizen Coins.
* Ability to transact between citizens.
* Registration of assets that may be lent.

### Phase Three: Participation
**Goal:** Strengthen community through participation.

By phase three we have engaged communities that know one another. They are helping one another on a personal basis and the Citizen Coin has an established value. With phase three we start to work together as a community by asking the question: *“What can we create together?”*.

Focussing on problems forces us to stay in the past. By focusing on possibilities we leave the past behind us and start to explore the world that could be.

#### Opportunities
Any citizen may raise an **opportunity**. An opportunity is something they have seen where there is potential to create something worthwhile. Fellow members of the community are then asked to contribute their ideas on what could be created from the opportunity. Those ideas that are seen as most worthwhile pursuing are then promoted to a proposal.

#### Proposals
A group of citizens who feel strongly that the idea is worthwhile create a **proposal**. The main aim of the proposal is to determine if it would cause harm to either a) The local community or b) The greater community. It’s also a mechanism to get people together in one place to openly discuss the topic together.

#### Initiatives
Assuming the proposal does not obviously cause any harm to the community then an **initiative** is started to implement the proposal.


If an initiative requires funding then the proposers may ask the community for Citizen Coins. By crowdfunding an initiative in this way only those that the community feel are worthwhile will be funded. Likewise if an initiative is overly ambitious it may not receive its funding target and should be broken down into smaller more manageable tasks.

Communities should be encouraged to engage with their local governments to get an allocation of community innovation funds. Local governments may purchase a certain quantity of Citizen Coins and distribute them evenly amongst their Citizens. Citizen Coins may be colour coded so that coins of a particular colour may only be spent in a certain way e.g. on initiatives.

More local shops and companies providing goods and services will start to accept Citizen Coins. 

**Requirements**:
* Creation of opportunities
* Gathering of ideas
* Raising proposals
* Generating initiatives
* Crowdsourcing initiatives
* Engagement with local government
* Ensuring payment via “Citizen Coin”

### Phase Four: Hybrid Democracy
**Goal:** First steps towards decentralization, citizens prove they can work together.

Citizens may now choose to be accountable for their own civic life. By “Opting in”, a citizen now has:

* Monthly Basic Income - In Citizen Coins.
* Control over their Tax money. 

#### Monthly Basic Income
In phases two and three we have an active community who are working with one another. A byproduct of this work is the generation of Citizen Coins. Citizen Coins that are created within a community are collected and distributed equally on a monthly basis amongst their members.

A citizen is trusted to spend their coins:
* Within the local economy 
* For community growth 
* For maintaining the community

A mechanism like colour coding of coins could be introduced to enforce this.

#### Control over community Tax
Since the community is now accountable for itself it knows what it needs, its citizens may choose to pay their taxes directly to institutions who provide services to the community i.e. Transport, education, health services, refuse collection, care for adults at risk etc.

With an increased awareness of itself, the community will no longer need to outsource many of the services that it used to i.e. Care for elderly residents. This would free up budget that could be used elsewhere, like education for the young.

**Note:** Civil Servants are still necessary for the ongoing support of the community and for carrying out initiatives. Instead of taking their orders from the top of a hierarchy they will take them from the will of the people.

**Requirements**:
* “Opt-in/out” mechanism integrated with Local Government
* Gathering of Citizen Coins
* Distribution of Citizen Coins
* Distribution of Tax via Citizen Coins

### Phase Five: Decentralization
**Goal:** Citizens are fully accountable for their own actions.

A centralised local government is no longer necessary. The citizens of the community are now accountable for:
* Building and maintaining their community.
* Ensuring a virile local economy.
* Caring for the organism that is their community.
* Making decisions about how their full potential could be realised.

Since all citizens receive a basic monthly income, they now have the choice as to how they spend their time. Alternatively citizens can subsidise their income with paid jobs in industry or in civil service.

All citizens choose how much tax they will pay for building and maintaining their community. Communities where more people work in industry will require a greater tax than communities that choose to support one another directly.

**Requirements**:
* Government of the people, by the people, for the people.
